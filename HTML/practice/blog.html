<!-- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
opening tag <  >
closing tab </ >
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
      These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

 A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.

 DECLARATION
 All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE >
-represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
-not case sensitive.
-for HTML5, <!DOCTYPE html>

HEADING
The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.
-HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.
-<h1> defines the most important heading. 
-<h6> defines the least important heading.

PARAGRAPH
HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag

html:5  (ENTER) -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html> -->

<!-- here,The <body> encapsulates the contents of the document,
     while the <head> part contains meta elements, i.e., information about the contents.

     (30) The lang attribute specifies the language of the element's content.
     (32) The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
          The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set.
     (33) Tells Internet Explorer to use the highest mode available to that version of IE. 
          Internet Explorer 8 can support up to IE8 modes, IE9 can support IE9 modes and so on. 
          X-UA-Compatible Meta Tag Type: The X-UA-Compatible meta tag is a http-equiv meta tag.
    (34)  
    The viewport meta tag tells the browser that the width of the screen should be considered the "Full Width" of the page.
    Meaning no matter the width of the device you are on, whether on desktop or mobile.
    the website will follow the width of the device the user is on.

    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). 
    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.
    (35) for title of the document.
        --Both the Title Tag and the H1 Tag share the same broader purpose.
        --Both serve as titles to describe what your webpage is about.
        --A title leads the entire document and captures its content in one or two phrases;
         a heading leads only a  section and captures only the content of that  section. -->
