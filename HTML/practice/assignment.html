<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
<h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
<h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>
    <!-- similarly we can give  till the heading 6 .so that Browsers recognize six headings-->
<!-- Is it possible to create more heading styles, like h7, h8, and so on?
then you'll be using an invalid element
still browsers treats it as para  -->
    <h7> HEY!</h7>
    <h8> Wel_Come</h8>
    <p> Here, You can find more stuff!</p>
    <p> A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.</p>
    <p> By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line 
        with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.</p>

        <p> if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph,<br>you can use the line break tag'br'</p>
        <p> This is also about Paragraphs <br> Lets Begin..!</p>

    <p>This is how we make a word appear <b>BOLD.</b> </p>
	<p> Also represents a "<b>section of text</b>" that would be presented in a visually different way</p>
    <p> Example: Inside a product description you might see some <b>key features</b> in bold.</p>
    <p>By enclosing words  and section of text in the tags "i" we can make characters appear <i>italic</i> .</p>

    <p>This is how we make a word appear in <sup>Power</sup> of something </p>
    <p>mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 2<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>This is how we make a word appear as <sub>Base</sub> of something </p>
    <p> chemical formulas such as H<sub>2</sub>0</p>
<!-- White Space
When the browser comes across
two or more spaces next to each
other, it only displays one space.
Similarly if it comes across a line
break, it treats that as a single
space too. This is known as
white space collapsing. -->
